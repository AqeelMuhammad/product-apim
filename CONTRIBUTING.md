## Building the Distribution from Source

To build the WSO2 API Manager distribution from source, follow these steps:

1. Install **Java SE Development Kit 11**.
2. Install **Apache Maven 3.x.x** ([Download Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#)).
3. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/wso2/product-apim.git` or download the source.
4. From the `product-apim` directory, run one of the following Maven commands:
    - `mvn clean install`  
      _(Builds the binary and source distributions with tests)_
    - `mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`  
      _(Builds the binary and source distributions without running any unit/integration tests)_
5. The binary distribution will be available in the `product-apim/all-in-one-apim/modules/distribution/product/target` directory.


## Bug Fixing

WSO2 API Manager is built with many components. The source code for each component resides in its own repository. The two main components used within the product are:

Core API Manager component: https://github.com/wso2/carbon-apimgt
UI components: https://github.com/wso2/apim-apps

Most product-related issues need to be fixed in these two components. Instructions for building each component can be found in the README files of their respective repositories.

Once you implement a bug fix, build the component locally.

To apply the fix to the product, you need to update the component version in the product.

For backend-related fixes, update the carbon-apimgt component version (e.g., <carbon.apimgt.version> to x.x.x-SNAPSHOT) in https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/blob/master/all-in-one-apim/pom.xml 

For UI-related fixes, update the apim-apps component version in <carbon.apimgt.ui.version> in https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/blob/master/all-in-one-apim/pom.xml 

After updating the version, rebuild the product-apim repository.

## Debug the Product

1. Unzip the product distribution (e.g., wso2am-4.5.0.zip).
2. Identify the component version used in the product. You can find this by:
    - Checking the component version in the `repository/components/plugins/` folder, or
    - Viewing the component version in the corresponding product release tag (ex: https://github.com/wso2/product-apim/blob/v4.5.0/all-in-one-apim/pom.xml for APIM 4.5.0).
3. Clone the relevant component repository and check out the tag that matches the component version. Example: The carbon-apimgt component version used in WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 is 9.31.86. The source code for this version is available at:
https://github.com/wso2/carbon-apimgt/tree/v9.31.86
4. Load the source code into your IDE.
5. Start the product in debug mode:
   - Navigate to wso2am-4.5.0/bin/
   - Run: `./api-manager.sh -debug 5005`
6. Connect to the server using your IDEâ€™s remote debug option.
